Tip: You can set a hotkey to toggle the script in OBS: File -> Settings -> Hotkey
Default hotkey name is 'MF Toggle Bounce' but this can be changed by modifying the HotkeyName string (~line 50 of lua script), which is useful if you are using multiple instances of the script to create different effects
