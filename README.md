<b>Tip:</b> You can set a hotkey to toggle the script in OBS: <b>File -> Settings -> Hotkeys</b><br>
Default hotkey name is 'MF Toggle Bounce' but this can be changed by modifying the HotkeyName string (~line 50 of lua script), which is useful if you are using multiple instances of the script to create different effects<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> OBS may display a crash notification when closing down due to a bug in OBS itself related to code used in this script (a memory leak apparently). It's not something that I can fix but it doesn't appear to cause any problems in OBS: no loss of scene structures, script settings, etc.
